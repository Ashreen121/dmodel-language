# Xtext project for dmodel 

This is an Xtext project that contains a simple grammar for my custom DSL called dmodel. This project was used to experiement with LSP features and capabilities of Xtext by generating a packaged language server of the dmodel language.

Below I outline the steps on how to generate the language server from this project.
